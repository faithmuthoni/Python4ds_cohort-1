# Master Python for Data Science Handbook - Log

## Week 1: Introduction: IPython: Beyond Normal Python
**(delete me or comment me out)**

**Today's Progress**: Went through the Python for Data Science Handbook and familiarized myself with the IPython commands. Experimented with a few of them just to see if I understood.

**Thoughts**: It was a bit challenging getting started, but overall I think I made significant progress. Using Git and Github is also new for me but I think I've gotten the hang of it.

## Week 2: Chapter 2: Introduction to Numpy

**This week's Progress**: Still struggling a bit with Github but should be able to push changes this week. Tried out a couple of the steps in the handbok and got most of them right on the first attempt. Noting down my errors to find out if they are mostly syntax or logic.

**Thoughts**:Numpy is interesting and relates with some of the things I have done in school, particularly in foundation mathematics units.
