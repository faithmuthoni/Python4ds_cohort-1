# Master Python for Data Science Handbook - Log

## Week 1: Introduction: IPython: Beyond Normal Python
**(delete me or comment me out)**

**Today's Progress**: Went through the Python for Data Science Handbook and familiarized myself with the IPython commands. Experimented with a few of them just to see if I understood.

**Thoughts**: It was a bit challenging getting started, but overall I think I made significant progress. Using Git and Github is also new for me but I think I've gotten the hang of it.
